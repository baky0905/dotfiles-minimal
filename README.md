# baky0905's dotfiles

Bootstrap your Ubuntu in a single command!

This dotfiles repository is currently aimed for [**Ubuntu on WSL**](https://ubuntu.com/wsl), [**Ubuntu Server**](https://ubuntu.com/server). See how to get started with WSL [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

It's also suitable for use in [**Gitpod**](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-dotfiles), [**VS Code Remote - Containers**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_personalizing-with-dotfile-repositories), or even Linux distribution that are not Ubuntu, through the [**minimum mode**](#minimum-mode).

Managed with [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io), a great dotfiles manager.


## Getting started

You can use the [convenience script ./scripts/install_dotfiles.sh](./scripts/install_dotfiles.sh) to install the dotfiles on any machine with a single command. Simply run the following command in your terminal:


> ðŸ’¡ We use `wget` here because it comes preinstalled with most Ubuntu versions. But you can also use `curl`:
>
> ```bash
>  sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/baky0905/dotfiles-minimal)"
> ```


### Minimum mode

The installation will ask if you want a **minimum mode installation**. The minimum mode only installs the needed dotfiles for the command prompt and is compatible with more distributions other than Ubuntu.

It will be enabled by default when running in a Dev Container or in distributions other than Ubuntu.


## Configuring the terminal font

This dotfiles uses the ZSH theme Powerlevel10k, so it requires you to install a font on your host machine with support for the Nerd Fonts glyphs. I recommend the FiraCode Nerd Font.

In Ubuntu Desktop, the dotfiles installation will take care of installing the font and set it up for you in GNOME Terminal.

But on other systems or terminal emulators, you will need to configure it manually. Here are some tips:
### Installing the font on **Windows**

1. [Download it by clicking here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/raw/HEAD/patched-fonts/FiraCode/Regular/complete/Fira%20Code%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.ttf).
2. Open it and click in **_Install_**.
3. Restart any applications that you want to load the font into.

### Configuring the font in **VS Code**

1. On **VS Code**, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> to open the settings.
2. Search for "**Terminal Font Family**", and write `FiraCode Nerd Font` in the entry named **_Terminal â€º Integrated: Font Family_**. Like below:

### Configuring the font in **Windows Terminal**

1. On **Windows Terminal**, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> to open the settings.
2. Go to **_Profiles -> Defaults_** in the left panel. Then, go to **_Additional settings -> Appearance_**.
3. At **_Text -> Font face_**, enable the **_Show all fonts_** option and select **_FiraCode Nerd Font_**. Like below:

## Documentation

**If you followed the steps above so far, you already finished installing the dotfiles. Have fun!**

The below information is more for reference purposes.

### Convenience script

The [getting started](#getting-started) step used the [convenience script](./scripts/install_dotfiles.sh) to install this dotfiles. There are some extra options that you can use to tweak the installation if you need.

It supports some environment variables:

- `DOTFILES_REPO_HOST`: Defaults to `https://github.com`.
- `DOTFILES_USER`: Defaults to `baky0905`.
- `DOTFILES_BRANCH`: Defaults to `master`.

### Installing without the convenience script

If you prefer not to use the convenience script to install the dotfiles, you can also do it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baky0905/dotfiles "$HOME/.dotfiles"

"$HOME/.dotfiles/install.sh"
```

---



### Extra scripts

There are some scripts here to help you automate tricky activities when setting up your machine.

If you already have this dotfiles [installed](#getting-started), you can use these scripts right away. Or, if you want to run it without installing the dotfiles, you can do something like:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baky0905/dotfiles/master/scripts/<script-name>")" -- <arguments>
```

Just replace `<script-name>` and `<arguments>` with the desired values. Example:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baky0905/dotfiles/master/scripts/create_alternative_chrome_shortcut.sh")" -- --force
```

#### [`create_alternative_chrome_shortcut.sh`](scripts/create_alternative_chrome_shortcut.sh)

##### Usage

```sh-session
$ scripts/create_alternative_chrome_shortcut.sh --help
Usage: scripts/create_alternative_chrome_shortcut.sh [-f|--(no-)force] [-h|--help] [<display-name>]
        <display-name>: The name which will be displayed in the app launcher (default: 'Alternative')
        -f, --force, --no-force: Do not ask for confirmation (off by default)
        -h, --help: Prints help

This script creates a new shortcut for Google Chrome which opens using a
different user data directory. This lets you have different icons for different
instances of Google Chrome.
